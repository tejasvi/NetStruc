# NetStruc

This is a repository for the notebook I have prepared for this year's (2016) NTU Winter School on Complexity Sciency. The notebook
is a supplementary material to Michael Lees and Debraj Roy's A Short Practical Introduction to NetworkX for the 
said winter school. The notebook is also the "hands-on" counterpart of the lecture I have prepared titled "Community Structures". I will be uploading 
the slide deck; download link to follow.


### Description
Real-world networks reveal clustering behaviour, which is exhibited in the formation of communities/clusters/partitions 
(used inerchangeably in this recipe) in the graph structure. When studying networks, their structure and function, 
it is therefore crucial to identify these bunchings. The concept of clustering and community detection oftentimes 
go hand-in-hand, and with other concepts such as cliques and connected components, to name a few, as well. Here, 
we explore these different structures with a strong strong focus on clustering and community detection by looking at two general
methods, and three submethods:

1. Divisive Method
  - Girvan-Newman Algorithm 
2. Agglomerative Method
  - Hierarchical clustering (distance matrix)
  - Louvain Algorithm
